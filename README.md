# Loan-Prediction
This project aims to predict loan approval using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical loan data to build a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of a loan application being approved. The project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel as the classification algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical features before training the model. Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. Feature importance analysis reveals the most influential factors in predicting loan approval. The project showcases the potential of machine learning in automating and streamlining the loan approval process, while suggesting areas for further improvement like exploring other algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering before real-world deployment. The code is written in Python using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The project's goal is to demonstrate a practical application of machine learning for loan risk assessment and decision-making.
